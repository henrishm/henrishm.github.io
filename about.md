## About
### Writings by Henrish Maluleka.
Enthusiastic about modern Java, Clojure, applying technology appropriately.
It looks like the tech world moves at break-neck speed but our ability to fully exploit these so-called ``advances`` remains hindered. I find real-time streaming systems fascinating and crucial to helping businesses transform. In these writings I delve into programming constructs supporting these so-called real-time systems from modern Java <em>(8 & up)</em> & Clojure. <em>I don't and won't ever pretend to be an expert at this.</em>
Enjoy the writings and don't be shy to point out my human fallibity. Cheers!
